19
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,811
 not get him. I'm so Gardening.

20
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,957
 Now, you can speak a bit? Yes.

21
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:56,207
 Okay,

22
01:03:56,207 --> 01:04:01,128
 I met today that company for the cable.

23
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:04,924
 Unfortunately, they don't have LFS unarmored cables.

24
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:10,471
 They have two types, one LFS and one the

25
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:13,683
 previous one which we ordered. What's the name?

26
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,892
 Not LFS before.

27
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:18,104
 Before we have to be used to order for the battery.

28
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,899
 So, they have two types of this insulation in the cables.

29
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,070
 Okay, only difference is that one. But

30
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,865
 both of it are armored. It's not flexible.

31
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:32,493
 What's flexible, what they have? Only

32
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,745
 a rubber cable. A rubber cable, yes.

33
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:35,830
 We cannot accept, right?

34
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,083
 It's no small cable. It's not low small cable. I don't

35
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,377
 think so. It's just a normal cable.

36
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,838
 So, we have to find another

37
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,299
 supplier if we can. So, I did this. Yes,

38
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,135
 I think in federal travel or a normal cable.

39
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,219
 Who is that normal cable? It's a

40
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,263
 normal cable. The resource is supplied.

41
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,055
 Can you share with me his

42
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,932
 contacts? Yes. Other contacts, yes.

43
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:55,349
 Okay,

44
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:59,353
 but only they think we need urgent materials.

45
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,563

46
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,065

01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:03,899
 Andrei,

48
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:04,734
 how are you?

49
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:10,615
 I'm... speak Russian, this one. Accent. I'm very good.

50
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:14,118
 I'm not sure if I can do that. But I think that I'm not

51
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:17,455
 sure if I can do that. I don't know.

52
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,831
 I don't know if I can do that.

53
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,750
 I think I can do that.

54
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,543
 Okay. What's the important

56
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:30,509
 It's a little bit different than the other one.

57
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,553
 I think it's a little bit different. It's a little bit

58
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:36,849
 different than the other one. It's not a small line, but

59
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:40,645
 it's not a big one. The least is a...

106
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:45,452
 No one keeps really?

107
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:53,919
 No, that one I need special fire rated.

108
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:54,961
 It's armored inside right?

109
01:17:54,961 --> 01:18:00,467
 Oh my god. For this one I have supplier but I just need

110
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:04,638
 flexible, special fire rated standard.

111
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:08,141
 So what's your offer? What I have to

112
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:10,811
 do? I need special fire rated table.

113
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:20,445
 So the model is asking us to bring LSF but LSF we cannot

114
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,906
 work because it's armored, it's not flexible.

115
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:23,949
 That's the issue.

116
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,993
 So in your experience what the

117
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,454
 suppliers are buying? Which cable?

118
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:30,330
 Fire rated?

119
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:31,081
 Oh, rubber cable.

120
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:31,832
 But it's armored right?

121
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,416
 I understood.

122
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:36,545
 Oh okay, okay. I understood, I understood. Okay, I will

123
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,589
 call you back. Thank you. Mi smit,

124
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:43,051
 no one company has LSF non-armored.

125
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:47,139
 No one has any supplier, we cannot find this one.

126
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:52,728
 All the customers they are using LSF armored cable.

127
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,771
 Inside the airports, inside the malls,

128
01:18:55,063 --> 01:19:01,111
 everywhere. We don't have to use that one.

129
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,363
 Just keep it tomorrow, try to explain

130
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:06,283
 him because it's not possible to find.

131
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,744
 Even that set cup or any other

132
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:12,664

133
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:17,961
 Okay, let's fix this task today.

134
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:24,384
 Andrew, can you explain us a little bit for the locations?

135
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:29,389
 Where we have to bake, where we have to store,

136
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:33,685
 where we have to keep the items, something like that. Yeah,

137
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:36,271
 we can start from the beginning. Let's do.

138
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,440
 How do you know where to put the items? I don't know.

139
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,068
 It's because of personal. It's because of personal, okay.

140
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,905
 Okay, so we have to go to the location.

141
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:50,660
 We have to take a lot of items from the place we are going

142
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:55,207
 to use, we have to take some items from the place we are

143
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,417
 going to use, we have to take some items from the place we

144
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:01,254
 are going to use. Okay. How do you know where to put the

145
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:04,716
 items? I don't know, just put the items from the place. I

146
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,760
 don't know. How do you know where to put your items?

147
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,385

 So we will go around for a few more locations.

 So the most important room for us is the security room. You

174

01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:03,598
 basically everything. He will send the raw materials to

181
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:12,190
 this side. We will keep here the most important materials

182
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:19,531
 and basically from which one the bakery is staying, it's a

183
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,492
 wheat. So we will keep the wheat here.

184
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:25,703
 Then we go for the cold room,

185
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:30,667
 a room for chemicals, for washing machines,

186
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:31,417
 dry machines.

187
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:36,297
 So here what we have here is...

188
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,341
 Can you remind me of this?

189
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:40,176
 This is just a store, right?

190
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:41,678
 This is just a store. This is

191
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:45,014
 the calculation office account.

192
01:25:45,014 --> 01:25:48,726
 We will sit here to check our profits,

193
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:52,021
 our losses, everything like that.

194
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:58,820
 So this laboratory? Yeah, at a sierza, in a chunese sierza.

195
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:03,199
 Okay, so this is the heart of the bakery, it's a

 Not smoking is that allowed.

221
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:32,538
 And again, cold room, we have basically six or seven cold

222
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:35,917
 rooms right here. So the validity of the

223

01:27:40,254 --> 01:27:41,839
 Right now, at Minas 3, please watch.

225
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:46,010
 So here basically we start for the

226
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:49,555
 production area. Here we will keep some mixers,

227
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:51,391
 equipment, stuff like that.

228
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:01,985

 case. This one and not the press.

232
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:13,037
 Press. Press, yeah, okay, press machines and then we go to

233
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:15,832
 the... to the room where the big...

234
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,667
 Punch guide Onto the

235
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:27,677
 So the ovens are located here and basically then everything

236
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:31,556
 under the process. So we keep the ovens.

237
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:36,144
 This is the oven. And now the oven is ready.

238
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,228
 Okay. The oven is ready.

239
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:37,437
 Yes.

240
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:38,354
 Yes. Yes.

241
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:39,230
 Yes. Yes.

242
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,398
 Yes. Yes.

243
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:50,575
 Yes. So how much is it? A half. Yes.

244
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:51,034
 Okay.

245
01:28:51,034 --> 01:29:00,793
 It was this. So here in this room we have two big tables which is not

246
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:04,464
 stainless steel even. It's a granite.

247
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:13,181
 Granite table, two granite tables, three meters each.

248
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:13,347
 Damn,

249
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:17,518
 you could take it like this but wait for a moment.

250
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:26,152
 This is the croissant, or like a friend. Croissant? No,

251
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:30,281
 croissant, but not croissant. No, it's not a croissant,

252
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:33,493
 it's a rascata, it's a resdial, it's a chest...

253
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,495
 It's more natural than a rolling pin.

254
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:36,662
 I'm going to eat a little bit of whiskey.

255
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:37,330
 That's all I have.

256
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:37,747
 That's a piece.

257
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:40,375
 A wadzinnik, a wadzinnik,

258
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,251
 cold room tables.

259
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:44,212
 Basically from here, the

260
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:47,590
 ready-made croissants going to the...

261
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:51,636
 Basically we have two ways. So the croissants, which is

262
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:59,644
 ready-made and fresh and hot, we will put to the car. And

263
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,230
 it's going directly from the bakery to the customers.

264
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:02,980
 Other way,

265
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,441
 the ready-made croissants, we put to the shock...

266
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:13,199
 ...of a shock room. A shock room, which is not a croissant.

267
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,661
 A shock room, which is not a croissant. A shock freezer,

268
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,287
 which is not a croissant.

269
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:21,582
 Okay, so the ready-made croissant,

270
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:21,833
 which is...

271
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:27,922
 We want to keep it frozen. We will put these croissants to

272
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:32,552
 the shock freezer, and we keep for the... ...sometimes, and

273
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:36,305
 then these croissants go directly to the cold room. So it

274
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:38,182
 will be delivered, for example, after a

275
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:40,393
 few hours, next day, something like that.

276
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,353
 Okay.

277
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:44,522
 Another protocol, the ready-made croissant.

278
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:48,317
ately Do you always feel the strength

279
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:59,412
 So, okay, behind you, Coldrom again. Here is for the ice

280
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:04,625
 cream. This area will be for the dark chocolate, milk

281
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:08,462
 chocolate, white chocolate. Here, production is there for

282
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:11,007
 the pastry. So, something delicious.

283
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:13,509
 Delicious things coming from exactly from this side.

284
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:24,312
 So, we have to put the laser in the pan. So, basically what

285
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:28,858
 we have also in our plan, we are keeping actually in the

286
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:33,571
 plan. So, here we want to put some laser machine. This

287
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:38,910
 laser will be for the paint to be cut.

288
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,869
 No,

289
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:42,413
 it will be for the paint to be cut.

290
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:51,047
 So, we will put the laser in the cut. It will be cut in the

291
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:53,716
 same way. It will be cut in the same way.

292
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:58,095
 So, it will be produced in a form. How do you say it? It

293
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:02,975
 will be produced in a form. It will be produced in a form.

294
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:09,857
 Okay, so, basically we will have here the laser machine,

295
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:17,073
 which can help us to create some different kind of forms

296
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:19,867
 for the cakes, the chocolate, etc.

297
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:26,374
 So basically we are coming

298
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,085
 almost to the end of our production.

299
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:32,964
 So from the left side we will keep our products in the cold

300
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:37,301
 room, so K-18. From the right side we will keep some

301
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:41,681
 products which is required, plus 6 plus 18, something like

302
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:46,143
 that. So basically all these products will come to that

303
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:52,233
 area where the car will come inside.

304
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:56,821
 So we have two engines here, this is a deep freeze and this

305
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,906
 is a normal temperature. The

306
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:03,160
 products will be loaded inside the truck.

307
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:07,039
 So this truck will have three sections, one section is

308
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:14,338
 minus 18. In the middle it's a plus 6 and plus 24, this is

309
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:17,675
 the last section. We will keep the products inside this

310
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:25,057
 car, so the car will deliver all the products and stuff

311
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:27,435
 directly to the customers or

312
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:31,147
 coffee shops or different locations.

313
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:47,330
 So basically I would say that 70% of the whole work is

314
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,166
 done. So right now we are waiting

315
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,251
 some approvals from the Bay municipality.

316
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:57,381
 We have to bring water supply, gas supply, some generators.

317
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:03,637
 We have to fix and do the installation for the AC and

318
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:06,766
 ventilation system, which is outside.

319
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:10,770
 And some few more things we have to finish, of course,

320
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:14,106
 inside also. We have to bring all

321
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:16,150
 the equipment, we have to connect it,

322
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,736
 we have to clean, do the cleaning properly.

323
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:20,738
 We have to bring the stuff,

324
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,657
 which is already passing the courses.

325
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:29,080
 I hope to see you guys in a few months, okay, when we

326
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,748
 finish all the projects. And

327
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:34,085
 we welcome you to the Mirabaker.

328
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:35,294
 How much months we finished?

329
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:37,797
 How many months till the end?

330
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:42,009
 Let's say we finish the construction. I hope, I believe we

331
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:47,139
 finish in 2-3 months. But this is maximum. We try our best

332
01:34:47,139 --> 01:34:52,228
 to finish it as soon as possible, of course. But yeah, we

333
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:55,773
 try our best to finish it like...

334
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,525
 Let's say 2-3 months, okay?

335
01:34:59,318 --> 01:35:00,986
 (Blank Audio)

336
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:04,824
 What's the next step? I have to hide remotely from your

337
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:18,254
 negotiating officer. Are you inside here? Yeah.

338
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,046
"I think so".

339
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:24,260
 Let's remember that Baileyshka made the same mistake.

340
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:21,567
 My name is Alex, I am general

341
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:24,195

 So basically my responsibility right now is to bring the

345
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:37,666

346
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:43,589

01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:20,376
 Mira Building Materials Company.

355
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:24,547
 What I'm doing right now, I'm supplying the materials for

356
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:31,345
 our construction sites and to our projects, such as we do

357
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,889
 one project near to us, it's a

358
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:37,851
 bakery. Then we have a few projects,

359
01:37:37,851 --> 01:37:40,312
 through SARDI apartments, we have

360
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:44,275
 projects at Mira Bentley Village.

361
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:49,280
 Plus we have a few projects like barbershops,

362
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:57,788
 food court in one of Dubai mall. As I told you what I'm

363
01:37:57,788 --> 01:38:01,625
 doing, it's supplying building materials for this project.

364
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:03,836
 Can you tell us again what's

365
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,921
 happening with the bakery right now?

366
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:09,008
 What's happening with the bakery right now? As we discussed

367
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:14,430
 before, 70% of the work is done. Right now we are on the

368
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:19,351
 final stage to do some connections, I mean the equipment.

369
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:23,564
 We are bringing equipment from outside of the country.

370
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:27,985
 So what we're going to do is to do connections.

371
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:30,112
 We have to do water supply,

372
01:38:30,112 --> 01:38:32,239
 we have to bring some generators,

373
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:37,578
 basically a few more things. It's like to

374
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:40,372
 finish the cold rooms, to bring the stuff,

375
01:38:40,372 --> 01:38:41,415
 to guide them,

376
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:44,793
 to show them their new workplace.

377
01:38:44,793 --> 01:38:49,840
 Some documentation and that's it. I hope in two or three

378
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,884
 months it will be done everything.

379
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:55,179
 What's the most difficult part of your job?

380
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:58,182
 I cannot say that it's something difficult.

381
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:04,480
 Some difficulties coming of course with the connections

382
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:13,113
 between me as a part of the Mira developments company and

383
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:18,744
 between the suppliers. Because what I see here in Dubai is

384
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:23,415
 very complicated to do the negotiations and connections to

385
01:39:23,415 --> 01:39:28,796
 the suppliers. Because everything what I'm trying to do is

386
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:31,131
 to bring the materials on time.

387
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:38,889
 This is a very important thing. I would say 50-50 is not

388
01:39:38,889 --> 01:39:41,558
 working as I wish because a lot of

389
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:44,520
 suppliers delay with the deliveries.

390
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,773
 So that's why the project is also

391
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:51,652
 getting delayed for the meantime.

392
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:56,782
 So it's time consuming when you're facing with the

393
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:59,910
 suppliers, right? Yeah, exactly.

394
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:00,577
 For example,

395
01:40:00,577 --> 01:40:05,165
 let's say I order some materials and I'm expecting to get

396
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:07,668
 these materials in two or three days. Then

397
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,878
 after two or three days what's happening?

398
01:40:09,878 --> 01:40:14,675
 It happens nothing because when I contact the suppliers and

399
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,927
 I'm asking what are my materials,

400
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:18,804
 which is paid already, everything.

401
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:25,978
 They have several things to say

402
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:29,523
 why the material is not coming.

403
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:34,194
 Like driver is sick, car is not working. I don't know.

404
01:40:34,653 --> 01:40:36,071
 Every time something happens,

405
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:40,701
 so 90% of the material I'm not getting one time. This is

406
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:50,586
 basically the root of the product.

407
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:56,216
 The reason,

408
01:40:56,216 --> 01:41:00,804
 as I said, the reason can be with the

409
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:03,640
 new product. Yeah, you're still just great.

410
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,308
 No, no problem.

411
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,810
 I'm really happy with it. Is it okay?

412
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:09,855
 I'm really happy with the new product.

413
01:41:09,855 --> 01:41:12,065
 I'm really happy with the new product.

414
01:41:12,107 --> 01:41:18,030
 I know as a customer to be good with you in negotiations,

415
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:21,617
 but exactly the reason why delay is coming.

416
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:25,954
 You know the things here, what's happening in Emirates.

417
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:27,790
 They are saying in Shala tomorrow.

418
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:29,917
 It means it can come after two

419
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:32,336
 days or it can come after one month.

420
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:34,213
 I don't know the reason.

421
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:48,143
 That's the most interesting and

422
01:41:48,143 --> 01:41:51,772
 popular question why. No one knows.

423
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:55,025
 I cannot say all the suppliers like that. No,

424
01:41:55,025 --> 01:41:57,778
 a lot of suppliers are good. They are

425
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:04,868
 trying to bring and to work with you on time,

426
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:13,168
 to be as a friend. But in my experience, some big orders,

427
01:42:13,919 --> 01:42:19,508
 which is expensive and which is so important for us.

428
01:42:19,508 --> 01:42:20,300
 They delayed.

429
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:25,013
 We didn't accept that, but what we can do?

430
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:30,394
 Nothing. We just have to keep going and try our best.

431
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:38,360
 Sometimes I ask the guys from the construction team to be

432
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,196
 late a little bit for one, two hours. It

433
01:42:41,196 --> 01:42:44,491
 depends just to finish. We have a schedule.

434
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:52,165
 The things have to be done for example today. If I see for

435
01:42:52,165 --> 01:42:58,255
 example we are not able to finish today. Sometimes I'm

436
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:00,799
 asking the guys just to stay a little bit longer,

437
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:03,427
 just to finish the task.

438
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:14,938
 Why you decided to take this kind

439
01:43:14,938 --> 01:43:18,400
 of job and it's very stressful. No,

440
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:27,492
 I cannot say. Is there some kind of will to do this or you

441
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:31,830
 want it to be from child or something like that? No, of

442
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:34,625
 course. It's not working here like that.

443
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:41,006
 On your childhood you are dreaming to be a doctor or an

444
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:42,883
 astronaut. No, it's not working like that.

445
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:45,177
 With this mirror I'm working already almost five years.

446
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:47,262
 These things are happening. I

447
01:43:47,262 --> 01:43:49,973
 didn't choose exactly that position.

448
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:51,850
 It's coming from the head managers.

449
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:55,979
 Basically I'm happy with what I'm doing here. I'm not that

450
01:43:55,979 --> 01:44:01,193
 person who is sitting in the office and all day playing,

451
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:02,110
 I don't know,

452
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:06,990
 doing some work in the laptop or working with the papers.

453
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:10,160
 I'm not that person. I'm a whole day from the early morning

454
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:15,666
 till late night. I'm driving around Dubai.

455
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,668
 I do the meetings with the suppliers.

456
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:26,969
 That kind of things I like to do. I'm feeling free from the

457
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:32,557
 one side. From another side I have my responsibility.

458
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:38,313
 I'm just combining these two things,

459
01:44:38,313 --> 01:44:46,238
 which brings me happy and fully loaded

460
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:48,240
 So you don't like to go to the office?

461
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:54,162
 Sometimes I have to, especially when I need to get some

462
01:44:54,162 --> 01:44:58,417
 petty cash or something like that. But usually I'm not

463
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:02,504
 staying in the office. I'm everywhere. We have five, six

464
01:45:02,504 --> 01:45:10,137
 projects right now. I'm dealing between these projects.

465
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:13,765
 One day I can visit three or four different locations.

466
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:16,727
 I have to bring some materials for that. Then I go to

467
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:18,937
 another supplier to arrange some materials for another.

468
01:45:18,937 --> 01:45:21,481
 So that's rolling.

469
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:24,234
 If we're going to speak about childhood dream,

470
01:45:24,234 --> 01:45:27,320
 what kind of dreams do you have when you're in the child?

471
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:36,121
 To be honest, I'm too old to remember my childhood. But I

472
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:39,666
 cannot say to you that because I really don't remember.

473
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:42,836
 I cannot tell you. I don't know. I

474
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:45,338
 really don't know what was my dream.

475
01:45:45,338 --> 01:45:53,972
 One thing I remember, I love motorcycles and motocross.

476
01:45:53,972 --> 01:45:57,642
 I remember those days when I was studying like...

477
01:45:57,642 --> 01:46:01,063
 I'm not sure what class I was studying.

478
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:02,022
 Eight grades. Great.

479
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:05,192
 When I was seven, eight grades,

480
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:13,867
 I used to do some motorsports with my grandfather.

481
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:18,038
 That day I was thinking, wow, I want to do these things. I

482
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:21,958
 want to be a famous sportsman or something like that. But

483
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:27,172
 the special position, somewhere to work...

484
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:29,925
 I didn't think about it. Never.

485
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:33,678
 But are you keeping this hobby right

486
01:46:33,678 --> 01:46:35,889
 now? Are you doing a motorcycle? Yeah.

487
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:38,058
 Two or three times per once,

488
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:39,726
 early Sunday,

489
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:41,311
 I'm going to the...

490
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:42,020
 So it's motocross?

491
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:48,652
 Yeah, it's some kind of motocross. But it's just a hobby

492
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:53,365
 for me. I'm renting the bike and I'm going to the desert

493
01:46:53,365 --> 01:47:01,414
 for two hours to spend only me and the motorcycle.

494
01:47:01,414 --> 01:47:03,917
 So I'm just relaxing. I'm driving.

495
01:47:03,917 --> 01:47:06,753
 I feel fully free at that time.

496
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:11,424
 I'm really excited to do this.

497
01:47:11,424 --> 01:47:14,302
 Best promotion for you back then. We'll

498
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:16,304
 see later, we'll cook a lot of beer...

499
01:47:16,304 --> 01:47:19,683
 Congressional I think it's pretty

500
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:28,942
 complete. So you can talk on the enabler...

501
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:30,026
 Well, no�� voiced.

502
01:47:30,026 --> 01:47:37,742
 Yes sir, I am in the liberal I guess Sami Aizizi is the

503
